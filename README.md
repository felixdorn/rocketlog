# PrivateLog

This is a fork of RocketLog that is easier to self-host (no billing, no websockets)

I forgot to actually fork it so:

[https://rocketlog.app](https://rocketlog.app) 
[https://github.com/jessarcher/rocketlog](https://github.com/jessarcher/rocketlog)

All good things should be credited to the original authors. All bad things are mine.
